# ChainableLedColorCycle

Example of using the ChainableRGB library for controlling a Grove RGB Led

## Getting started

For this project you need a [Grove Chainable RGB LED](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Chainable_RGB_LED/)

#### ```/src``` folder:  
This is the source folder that contains the firmware files for your project. It should *not* be renamed.
Anything that is in this folder when you compile your project will be sent to our compile service and compiled into a firmware binary for the Particle device that you have targeted.

#### ```.ino``` file:
This file is the firmware that will run as the primary application on your Particle device. It contains a `setup()` and `loop()` function, and can be written in Wiring or C/C++.

#### ```project.properties``` file:  
This is the file that specifies the name and version number of the libraries that your project depends on. Dependencies are added automatically to your `project.properties` file when you add a library to a project using the `particle library add` command in the CLI or add a library in the Desktop IDE.

## Adding additional files to your project

#### Projects with multiple sources
If you would like add additional files to your application, they should be added to the `/src` folder. All files in the `/src` folder will be sent to the Particle Cloud to produce a compiled binary.

If your application contains multiple files, they should all be included in the `src` folder. If your firmware depends on Particle libraries, those dependencies are specified in the `project.properties` file referenced below.
